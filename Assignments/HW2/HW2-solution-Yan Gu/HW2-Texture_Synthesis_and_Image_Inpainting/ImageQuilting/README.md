# Patch-Based-Texture-Synthesis
It's an implementation of Efros and Freeman's "Image Quilting and Texture Synthesis" 2001

The output depends on two factors : PatchSize and OverlapWidth
The running time depends on Sample Image dimensions, Desired Image dimensions, ThresholdConstant and PatchSize

It is downloaded from https://github.com/afrozalm/Patch-Based-Texture-Synthesis and I make some modifications.
